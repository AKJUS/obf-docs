about: 'This template is for the OBF Event Fellowship chair to manage a new application round'

**OBF Event Fellowship Round:**

- [ ] Round-1: 15 May
- [ ] Round-2: 15 September
- [ ] Round-3: 15 January

**Before opening the call for application (minimum 6 weeks in advance)**

*7-8 weeks before the deadline:*
- [ ] Update the application form with the correct date and application round-specific information (such as BOSC participation)
- [ ] Create a blog post for the announcement
- [ ] Get the board to review the blog, and when the majority agrees, publish the blog
- [ ] Cross-post announcements on Twitter, Slack and newsletter (OBF or other projects)
- [ ] If possible, host a webinar to share tips and suggestions with the potential applicants

*1-2 weeks before the deadline:*
- [ ] Amplify the announcement
- [ ] Create a folder for the specific round (within the dedicated directory for event fund) in the OBF-board shared google drive (round-specific shared folder)
- [ ] Within that folder, create a copy of the rubric template to share with the board when the review begins
- [ ] Double check if any application has come through that may need to follow up for any missing detail

**After the deadline**

- [ ] Export the full application in a Google sheet and store it in the round-specific shared folder
- [ ] Create a new sheet in the file to replace the 'time stamp' column with a pseudo key for each applicant
- [ ] Copy the new sheet to another file for 'anonymised applications' -> remove columns with name, email, affiliation and any strongly identifiable information -> this will be shared with the board
- [ ] Share the link of this anonymised applications sheet on the copy of the review form that will be shared with the board
- [ ] Share a summary from this application round and ask for 3-4 volunteers from the board who are available to review applications
- [ ] Create new columns in the anonymised applications file to allocate applications to reviewers - make sure to have at least two reviewers per application
- [ ] Give 10-14 days for reviewers, after which create an overview of reviews (yes, no, maybe) to share with the board
- [ ] In case of conflict of interest or opposing review outcome, allocate review to an extra reviewer with 2-4 days of application review time
- [ ] For applications that need extra discussion, either set a meeting or bring it to the next board meeting
- [ ] Mediate discussion via email to conclude all applications by the end of 3 weeks after the deadline

**After review**

- [ ] Communicate the final decision based on review comments and the board's suggestion
- [ ] Email both the awarded and declined application - provide feedback where possible (email drafts in the shared folder)
- [ ] Help awardees to answer any questions they may have regarding the fellowship - refer to the (Travel_fellowships.md)[./Travel_fellowships.md] document for consistency
- [ ] And entry to the budget spreadsheet including any award cap

**After an awardee finishes their event**

- [ ] Create a WordPress account for them in the OBF website account (add a new user -> use name and email to create a profile -> give 'contributor access' -> create a user id and password to share)
- [ ] Email the awardee their WordPress user id and password with some information on how to log in and create a new post
- [ ] Ask awardees to share a draft for a blog post in a Google Doc or any editable file that board members can edit before publishing
- [ ] After review, ask the awardee to share the post in WordPress under draft mode
- [ ] Use Event fund tag and meaningful post title
- [ ] Shorten permalink (by default WordPress uses full title in link)
- [ ] When agreed, publish the post and share the link by email informing the treasurer to go ahead with the reimbursement process
- [ ] Share the link to the blog post on Twitter, Slack and the post for the next round of application
- [ ] Update the budget spreadsheet once the award is paid
