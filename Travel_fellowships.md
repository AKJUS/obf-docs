#Open Bioinformatics Foundation Travel Fellowships

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation ([OBF](https://www.open-bio.org)) is pleased to announce a new OBF Travel Fellowship program aimed at increasing diverse participation at events promoting open source bioinformatics software development and open science in the biological research community. 

##Who can apply?
Anyone participating in open source software development or developing / promoting other aspects of open science in biology. Applicants should be able to document their public activity in the project(s) being discussed / developed at the event. Projects need not be OBF member projects. Preference will be given to applicants who increase diversity at the event they intend to attend. We understand increasing diversity as increasing participation from groups otherwise underrepresented in the community or at the event, including but not limited to underrepresented demographic groups, ethnic origins, career stages, and people with disabilities.

##Which events qualify?
Any event that aims to develop or promote open source development and open science in the biological research community. This includes - but is not limited to - conferences, workshops, codefests, and hackathons. 

##What does the fellowship cover?
The fellowship can be used to cover airfare, hotel and / or conference registration fees up to a value of $1000. The OBF will reimburse the recipient after the event based on receipts provided and proof of attendance. There is no cash value beyond eligible and documented expenses. If you anticipate that you would require more than $1000 in order to attend the event, please include that information on the application form. 

##Who will review the applications?
The applications will be considered by the OBF Board of Directors. Individual directors with a clear conflict of interest will recuse themselves.

**Application Deadlines**: April 15, August 15, December 15

**To apply**: Fill out [the application form]. Applicants will be notified of the outcome no later than 3 weeks after the application deadline.
